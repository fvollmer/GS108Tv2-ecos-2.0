Build and Install instructions for building eCos for the GS716T/GS724T
platforms.

March 1, 2009
Toroki

1) Important note
  a) Revision:
     These instructions and the accompanying eCos sources were collected prior
     to final release and may not represent the final product.
  b) Environment:
     During development of the GS716T/GS724T, these source were built on
     a machine running Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.2.

2) Environment configuration
  a) Tool-chain:
     These sources are configured to use, and were tested using the
     gcc compiler mipsisa32-elf-gcc (gcc version 3.2.1 (eCosCentric)).
     In the Toroki development environment, this compiler is located
     at /home/share/lvl7/ecos/mipsisa32-elf/bin and this was configured
     through setting the PATH environment variable as follows:
        export PATH=/home/share/lvl7/ecos/mipsisa32-elf/bin:$PATH

3) Build
  a) Unpack (fetch, sync, etc) the sources and change directory into the root of
     the source tree.
  b) Build the system by running 'make'
  c) The libraries and headers/include files needed for the application build
     will be located in the sub directory output/ecos-2.0--raptor/install.
         output/ecos-2.0--raptor/install/lib
         output/ecos-2.0--raptor/install/include

4) Installation
  For building the GS716T/GS724T FastPath application, copy the contents
  of the output directory output/ecos-2.0--raptor/install/* into the
  application directory vobs/bsp/platform/broadcom/gs7xxt/ecos-libs

  i.e. 'cp output/ecos-2.0--raptor/install/* <app_directory>/vobs/bsp/platform/broadcom/gs7xxt/ecos-libs'

  (It may be necessary to adjust permissions in order to perform this
  copy operation)
